## How To Install

This package uses the [scoped registry](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-scoped.html) feature to import dependent
packages. Please add the following sections to the package manifest file
(`Packages/manifest.json`).

To the `scopedRegistries` section:

```json
{
  "name": "iBicha",
  "url": "https://registry.npmjs.com",
  "scopes": [ "com.ibicha" ]
}
```

To the `dependencies` section:

```json
"com.ibicha.youtube-player": "3.3.1"
```

After changes, the manifest file should look like below:

```json
{
  "scopedRegistries": [
    {
      "name": "iBicha",
      "url": "https://registry.npmjs.com",
      "scopes": [ "com.ibicha" ]
    }
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "com.ibicha.youtube-player": "3.3.1",
    ...
```

## Usage

See the package samples for more usage examples. They can be imported from the package manager.

## Invidious instances

Starting with UnityYoutubePlayer 3.0.0, we're using [https://github.com/iv-org/invidious](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious), a self-hosted alternative front-end to YouTube.

Invidious has a community of volenteers who provided public instances, which can be found at [https://api.invidious.io](https://api.invidious.io). These are great for getting familiar with Invidious, and for testing, prototyping, and demos. Once you're ready for scaling your game and anticipate a lot of traffic, please consider hosting your own instances to avoid abusing these resources. This will also allow you to be in control of your Invidious instance(s), and generally have a better performance by isolating your game users from other users.
