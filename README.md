# UnityYoutubePlayer
Play and download youtube videos in Unity using [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) and Unity's VideoPlayer, and uses [youtube-dl-server](https://github.com/iBicha/youtube-dl-server) to fetch metadata from youtube-dl.

Please note that WebGL is not supported because of [CORS](https://github.com/iBicha/UnityYoutubePlayer/issues/40)

## Play youtube videos without this package
##### :warning: https://unity-youtube-dl-server.herokuapp.com is a demo server that you were able to use in the past, but now is no longer available. This is due to Heroku getting rid of their free tier plan. See [comment](https://github.com/iBicha/UnityYoutubePlayer/issues/96#issuecomment-1422901605)

That's right, **you don't even need to install this package to play youtube videos in Unity.**

Just change the url you want to play from
```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PuGuqpHQGo
```
To
```
https://unity-youtube-dl-server.herokuapp.com/watch?v=1PuGuqpHQGo&cli=yt-dlp
```

And use it directly in a [VideoPlayer](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Video.VideoPlayer.html) component. It will automatically redirect to the raw video format that can be played in Unity (in most cases)

But for a better reliability, you might want to [host your own youtube-dl-server](#how-do-i-host-my-own-youtube-dl-server)

If you are targetting **desktop platforms, it is recommended that you use the package**, since it will be faster, and does not need a server.

## How To Install

This package uses the [scoped registry](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-scoped.html) feature to import dependent
packages. Please add the following sections to the package manifest file
(`Packages/manifest.json`).

To the `scopedRegistries` section:

```
{
  "name": "iBicha",
  "url": "https://registry.npmjs.com",
  "scopes": [ "com.ibicha" ]
}
```

To the `dependencies` section:

```
"com.ibicha.youtube-player": "2.0.2"
```

After changes, the manifest file should look like below:

```
{
  "scopedRegistries": [
    {
      "name": "iBicha",
      "url": "https://registry.npmjs.com",
      "scopes": [ "com.ibicha" ]
    }
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "com.ibicha.youtube-player": "2.0.2",
    ...
```

## Usage
- A minimalistic example:
```
public class SimpleYoutubeVideo : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        GetComponent<VideoPlayer>().PlayYoutubeVideoAsync("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PuGuqpHQGo");
    }
}
```
Or,

- Add a `YoutubePlayer` component on a `GameObject` with a `VideoPlayer`. Set the url in the inspector.
The `YoutubePlayer` will follow the `Play On Awake` setting of the video player. You can also call `YoutubePlayer.PlayVideoAsync`.

- In addition, you can call `YoutubePlayer.DownloadVideoAsync` to download the video to a file instead. See the `DownloadYoutubeVideo` as an example.

- `VideoPlayerProgress` allows to display the progress of the video, as well as seeking.

- See `Assets\YoutubePlayer\Scenes` for more examples.

## Dependencies
UnityYoutubePlayer uses [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) and [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for parsing webpages and getting a raw video url that Unity's VideoPlayer can play.
To allow maximum platform compatibilty (e.g. mobile, desktop) and to be able to update the library without rebuilding the game, we're using [youtube-dl-server](https://github.com/iBicha/youtube-dl-server) web API.

The package uses a free instance of the server hosted on heroku (shared between everyone). 
For better reliability and performance, it is recommended to host this on your own.

Starting with 1.5.1, this package downloads and uses `youtube-dl` locally on Desktop platforms.

Starting with 1.7.0, this package downloads and uses `yt-dlp` locally on Desktop platforms, in addition to `youtube-dl`.

### How do I host my own youtube-dl server?
 - Go to [youtube-dl-server](https://github.com/iBicha/youtube-dl-server)
 - Click the `Deploy to Heroku` purple button
 - Finish the setup on Heroku.
 - Make `YoutubePlayer` use your newly hosted instance:
To make `YoutubePlayer` use your instance of the server, make sure to set the `ServerUrl` before making calls to youtube APIs, e.g.
```
YoutubeDl.ServerUrl = "http://your-self-hosted-server.com";
```
For reference, the default instance is 
```
YoutubeDl.ServerUrl = "https://unity-youtube-dl-server.herokuapp.com";
```
And you can test it in the browser: https://unity-youtube-dl-server.herokuapp.com/v1/video?url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PuGuqpHQGo&schema=url

or https://unity-youtube-dl-server.herokuapp.com/watch?v=1PuGuqpHQGo
